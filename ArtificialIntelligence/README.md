# Artificial Intelligence
In years past we have used this site for teaching machine learning to students as the basis for our problem sets: [ML4K](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/)


Because of the on-site resources, any tool for the core content should be web-based and have both typed and drag-and-drop capabilities. 

More advanced AI tools may be used with Google Colab has cloud-based dependency management for python packages.
