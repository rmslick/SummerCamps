# Python Start up
### About

Content for this camp has no limitations. Anything python goes. In the past we have relied heavily on problem sets and leaderboards to invoke fun competition. 

This camp has also come in different flavors. It has had a Harry Potter theme in the past and you are free to get as creative as you please.
